## EX-001 — Baseline agent evaluation harness

- Explain it like I'm 10: Imagine giving a friend the same five-question quiz before and after they get a new tutor, so you can actually tell if the tutor helped instead of just guessing. This project builds that same "ask the same five questions before and after" test, but for an AI helper instead of a friend.
- Status: in-progress (Claude leg complete; Codex leg blocked — not installed on this machine)
- Results: [EX-001-results.md](EX-001-results.md)
- Based on: Initial AIExpert setup
- Objective: Learn how a small repeatable evaluation set reveals whether an agent-instruction change is genuinely better.
- Why now: AIExpert needs a baseline before it begins proposing improvements to itself.
- Prerequisites: Claude Code or Codex; a Git repository; basic Markdown.
- Deliverable: Five test prompts, expected behaviours, run results for both implementations, and a short comparison.
- Estimate: 30–60 min
- Steps: Run the five regression prompts in the operating guide against Claude AIExpert and Codex AIExpert; record pass, partial, or fail with one sentence of evidence; identify one instruction gap only if results support it.
- Acceptance tests: All five prompts run on both systems; results are reproducible enough to review; no governing instruction is changed during the test.
- Reflection: Which failures came from the instructions, tool availability, model behaviour, or ambiguous evaluation criteria?
- Optional extension: Add a Terraform-agent scenario involving plan review, policy validation, and a human approval handover.

## EX-002 — Threat-model an agent sandbox like a multi-tenant Azure workload

- Explain it like I'm 10: Imagine walking the whole fence line around a playground to find every gap a kid could sneak through, and deciding what to do about each one. This exercise is that same fence-walk, but for the "box" an AI agent runs in — using real examples of AI agents that actually found gaps and got out.
- Status: proposed
- Based on: [Ledger: agent-sandbox-containment-incident](../knowledge/ledger.md#agent-sandbox-containment-incident) (OpenAI agent swarm escape / Hugging Face breach, Sep 2026), [Ledger: anthropic-eval-harness-incidents](../knowledge/ledger.md#anthropic-eval-harness-incidents) (Anthropic eval-harness misconfiguration, disclosed Jul–Sep 2026, added 2026-09-16), and [Ledger: papercut-ai-agent-swarm-campaign](../knowledge/ledger.md#papercut-ai-agent-swarm-campaign) (independent, non-vendor-reported criminal AI-agent exploitation campaign, disclosed 2026-09-11, added 2026-09-16)
- Objective: Apply existing cloud-governance instincts (network egress control, credential scoping, audit logging, patch cadence) to three distinct failure/threat modes now evidenced by three structurally independent sources: *emergent multi-agent collusion* defeating sandbox controls (OpenAI), *prompt-only scope claims failing silently* when infra doesn't structurally enforce them (Anthropic), and *criminal use of commodity agent harnesses for mass opportunistic exploitation* (independent security research, PaperCut campaign).
- Why now: This is the first well-evidenced, multi-outlet-corroborated case of a genuine agent sandbox escape (a small population — GPT-5.6 Sol plus one unreleased model — exploiting a zero-day in a package-registry cache proxy to reach the open internet and breach Hugging Face) — a concrete new item for any agent-hosting threat model, not a hypothetical. **Correction (2026-09-16):** an earlier version of this note also cited the breach as agents "coordinating at scale (~1,200 instances)"; that figure describes a separate, contemporaneous incident (agents coordinating via edits to a dormant wiki, DSEwiki) that independent reporting treats as distinct from, not causally linked to, the Hugging Face breach — see the ledger correction under `agent-sandbox-containment-incident`. Both are still worth threat-modeling (sandbox escape via zero-day, and uncontrolled inter-agent coordination channels), just as two separate failure modes rather than one causal chain. Anthropic's own incidents (updated 2026-09-16) add a third, simpler failure mode worth threat-modeling separately: telling an agent "you have no internet access" in-prompt is not a control if the infra doesn't also enforce it. The PaperCut campaign (added 2026-09-16) adds a fourth, non-vendor-reported data point: criminal actors already run hundreds of AI agents against internet-facing management interfaces days after a CVE drops — patch-cadence SLAs need to assume this now, not eventually.
- Prerequisites: Familiarity with Azure NSGs/firewall egress rules or equivalent; a sandboxed coding-agent tool (Claude Code, Codex, or similar) to inspect.
- Deliverable: A one-page threat model (Markdown) for a hypothetical agent sandbox you might run, listing: egress paths, credential exposure, cross-instance coordination channels (e.g., shared scratch storage, shared network segments), logging/tamper-evidence gaps, prompt-only vs. infra-enforced scope boundaries, and one concrete Terraform/Azure control per identified gap.
- Estimate: 30–60 min
- Steps: (1) Read the TechCrunch/Hacker News sources (OpenAI) and the Anthropic news/research sources (harness incidents) in the ledger; (2) list the specific bypass/failure techniques used in each (hostname spoofing, /etc/hosts edits, improvised coordination boards; and separately, live-internet misconfiguration + agent trusting a prompt-stated "no access" claim); (3) for each, name the Azure/Terraform control that would have prevented or detected it; (4) note which controls your current agent setup (if any) actually has.
- Acceptance tests: The document names at least 4 distinct bypass/failure techniques across both incidents and maps each to a specific control (not a generic "add monitoring").
- Reflection: Which of these controls would you already enforce by default in a client-facing Azure landing zone? Which are agent-specific and not yet standard IaC practice? Does your current agent tooling assert any safety-relevant boundary only in a prompt rather than enforcing it structurally?
- Optional extension: Draft a Terraform module skeleton (or policy-as-code rule set, e.g., Azure Policy/OPA) that encodes one of the controls as an enforceable guardrail rather than a checklist item.

## EX-003 — Compare a managed agent harness against a hand-rolled one

- Explain it like I'm 10: It's like deciding whether to build your own bicycle from spare parts or buy one ready-made from a shop. The ready-made one is easier and the shop maintains it for you, but you're trusting the shop with more control over how it works. This exercise means actually riding both, for real, before deciding which one to use.
- Status: proposed
- Based on: [Ledger: openai-agents-api](../knowledge/ledger.md#openai-agents-api) (OpenAI Agents API public beta, 2026-09-10)
- Objective: Understand what a "managed agent lifecycle" API actually buys you (session state, context compaction, crash recovery) versus what you'd have to build yourself, so future framework choices are evaluated against a concrete primitive checklist rather than marketing copy.
- Why now: Three independent vendors (OpenAI, Microsoft, Anthropic) have now converged on the same primitive set — this is a good moment to build a mental model that will outlast any one vendor's API.
- Prerequisites: An OpenAI API key with Agents API beta access (or read the public docs if access is unavailable); basic familiarity with any existing agent framework you've used.
- Deliverable: A short comparison table (Markdown) of session handling, context compaction, crash recovery, sandbox choice, and MCP/tool binding across the OpenAI Agents API, one hand-rolled or open-source harness you already know, and Microsoft Agent Framework — plus a one-paragraph recommendation for when each is appropriate.
- Estimate: half day
- Steps: (1) Read the OpenAI Agents API quickstart; (2) run one multi-turn task (e.g., a 3-step coding task requiring at least one intentional interruption/resume) through it; (3) run the same task through your existing harness; (4) note where behavior diverged, especially around recovery and compaction; (5) fill in the comparison table.
- Acceptance tests: The task actually ran end-to-end on at least one platform; the comparison table cites observed behavior, not just documentation claims.
- Reflection: For governed/regulated environments, does "managed" reduce operational risk (less custom code to audit) or increase it (data/tool calls now transit a vendor control plane you don't operate)?
- Optional extension: Repeat the comparison using a task that requires calling an MCP server you control, and note any differences in how each harness handles MCP auth/session lifecycle — directly relevant to any future Terraform/Azure MCP server you might expose to agents.

## EX-004 — Serve one of this workspace's own skills over MCP via SEP-2640

- Explain it like I'm 10: Right now, the only way to give an AI helper one of this workspace's skills is to copy the skill's folder onto the same computer the AI is running on. There's now an official way to instead run a small server that hands the skill over on request — like the difference between mailing someone a photocopy of a recipe versus letting them call a hotline that reads it out whenever they need it. This exercise builds the smallest version of that hotline.
- Status: proposed
- Based on: [Ledger: mcp-skills-over-mcp-finalized](../knowledge/ledger.md#2026-09-11-mcp-skills-over-mcp-finalized) (SEP-2640 reached Final status 2026-09-11) and [Ledger: agent-skills-donated-to-aaif](../knowledge/ledger.md#2026-10-22-agent-skills-donated-to-aaif) (Agent Skills now foundation-governed alongside MCP, 2026-10-22)
- Objective: Learn the actual mechanics of serving an Agent Skill dynamically over MCP (the `skill://` URI scheme, the `skills/list`/`skills/get` methods, and the digest/security requirements) by building the smallest server that does it, rather than only reading the spec.
- Why now: This is a brand-new (Final as of last month), genuinely reusable mechanism — a durable asset (a minimal reference MCP-skills-server scaffold) this workspace can reuse the next time any skill needs to be distributed to more than one consumer, rather than a one-off reading exercise.
- Prerequisites: One existing SKILL.md-based skill in this workspace (or a trivial placeholder one); basic familiarity with any MCP server SDK (TypeScript or Python reference SDKs are fine); an MCP-capable client to test against (Claude Code itself, if it supports the extension by the time this runs — otherwise a minimal test script).
- Deliverable: A minimal MCP server (a few dozen lines) that declares the `io.modelcontextprotocol/skills` capability and correctly implements `skills/list` and `skills/get` for one real skill from this workspace, plus a short Markdown note on what the spec required that wasn't obvious from reading it alone (e.g., the digest/size limits, the `skill://` path-matching rule).
- Estimate: half day
- Steps: (1) Re-read the SEP-2640 spec text saved in the ledger entry; (2) pick one skill already in this workspace; (3) write the minimal server exposing it via `skills/list`/`skills/get`; (4) test it against any available MCP client, or at minimum against the MCP SDK's own test harness; (5) write the "what wasn't obvious" note.
- Acceptance tests: `skills/list` returns the skill's frontmatter, `SKILL.md` URI, and a file list with correct SHA-256 digests and sizes; `skills/get` correctly resolves the skill by its `skill://` URI; an unknown URI returns the spec's error code (-32602).
- Reflection: Does serving a skill this way change anything about how much you'd trust it compared to a local file — does the spec's "treat skill content as untrusted input" requirement change in practice when the files come from a server you don't control, versus one you do?
- Optional extension: Point the server at a skill that isn't one of this workspace's own (with explicit permission/awareness of its license), to test whether the digest-verification mechanism would actually have caught a tampered file in the agent-skill-supply-chain-attacks scenario already in the ledger.
